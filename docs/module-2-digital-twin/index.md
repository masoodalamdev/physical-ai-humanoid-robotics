# Module 2: Digital Twins (Gazebo & Unity)

## Overview

Welcome to Module 2, where we explore digital twin technologies for humanoid robotics development. This module focuses on creating accurate virtual representations of our physical humanoid robot, enabling safe testing, development, and validation of control algorithms before deployment on real hardware.

### Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will:

- Understand the principles and applications of digital twins in robotics
- Create realistic simulation environments using Gazebo
- Develop Unity-based visualization and testing tools
- Integrate simulation environments with ROS 2 communication
- Validate humanoid robot behaviors in virtual environments
- Implement physics-based simulation for humanoid locomotion

### Module Prerequisites

- Completion of Module 1 (ROS 2 foundation)
- Basic understanding of 3D modeling concepts
- Familiarity with physics simulation principles

### Estimated Completion Time

4-6 weeks depending on prior experience with simulation tools

### Module Structure

This module is organized into the following sections:

1. **Digital Twin Concepts**: Understanding virtual-physical system integration
2. **Gazebo Simulation**: Physics-based simulation environment
3. **Unity Visualization**: High-fidelity visualization and interaction
4. **ROS 2 Integration**: Connecting simulation to robotic control
5. **Physics Modeling**: Accurate representation of humanoid dynamics
6. **Validation Techniques**: Testing and verification in simulation

### Why Digital Twins for Humanoid Robotics?

Digital twins are essential for humanoid robotics because they:

- **Reduce Risk**: Test dangerous or complex behaviors safely
- **Accelerate Development**: Parallel development of hardware and software
- **Enable Reproducible Testing**: Consistent environments for algorithm validation
- **Cost-Effective**: Reduce need for expensive hardware prototypes
- **Scalable Testing**: Test multiple scenarios simultaneously

### Simulation Tools in This Module

We'll focus on two primary simulation environments:

- **Gazebo**: Physics-accurate simulation with realistic dynamics
- **Unity**: High-fidelity visualization and user interaction

Both environments will be integrated with ROS 2 to ensure seamless transition between simulation and real hardware.
