# Module 1: ROS 2 – The Robotic Nervous System

## Overview

Welcome to Module 1, where we establish the foundational communication and control infrastructure for humanoid robotics using ROS 2 (Robot Operating System 2). This module serves as the "nervous system" of our robotic platform, enabling different components to communicate, coordinate, and function as a unified system.

### Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will:

- Understand the architecture and core concepts of ROS 2
- Implement nodes, topics, services, and actions for robotic communication
- Design message structures for humanoid robot data exchange
- Configure ROS 2 for real-time robotic applications
- Create basic control interfaces for humanoid robot components

### Module Prerequisites

- Basic understanding of Linux command line
- Familiarity with Python or C++ programming
- Understanding of basic robotics concepts (helpful but not required)

### Estimated Completion Time

4-6 weeks depending on prior experience with robotics frameworks

### Module Structure

This module is organized into the following sections:

1. **ROS 2 Concepts**: Core architecture and communication patterns
2. **Node Development**: Creating and managing ROS 2 nodes
3. **Communication Patterns**: Topics, services, and actions
4. **Humanoid-Specific Interfaces**: Messages and services for humanoid robots
5. **Real-time Considerations**: Performance and timing for robotic control
6. **Integration Labs**: Connecting to simulation and hardware

### Why ROS 2 for Humanoid Robotics?

ROS 2 provides the essential infrastructure for humanoid robotics by offering:

- **Decentralized Architecture**: Components can run on different machines
- **Language Independence**: Support for Python, C++, and other languages
- **Package Management**: Reusable components and libraries
- **Simulation Integration**: Seamless transition between simulation and hardware
- **Real-time Capabilities**: Deterministic behavior for safety-critical applications

- [Simulation Environment Setup](./setup.md)

### Next Steps

After completing this module, you'll have established the communication backbone for your humanoid robot. You'll be ready to move to Module 2, where we'll create digital twin environments to safely test and develop our robotic systems.
