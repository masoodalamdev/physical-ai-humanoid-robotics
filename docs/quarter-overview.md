# Quarter Overview

## The Journey from AI to Embodied Intelligence

This quarter-long curriculum is structured to take you from foundational concepts to advanced implementations in Physical AI and Humanoid Robotics. Each module builds upon the previous one, creating a comprehensive understanding of how artificial intelligence can be embodied in physical systems.

### Module Progression

The curriculum is designed with a clear progression that mirrors the development of a real humanoid robot system:

1. **Foundation** (Module 1): Establishing the communication and control backbone
2. **Simulation** (Module 2): Creating safe, repeatable testing environments
3. **Intelligence** (Module 3): Implementing AI-driven decision making
4. **Integration** (Module 4): Combining perception, language, and action

### Learning Philosophy

This course follows the principle of **modular learning** where each component can be understood independently while contributing to the larger system. The approach emphasizes:

- **Engineering-First Explanations**: Concepts grounded in practical implementation
- **Minimal, Reproducible Code**: Examples that can be easily understood and extended
- **Open Standards Preference**: Using industry-standard tools and frameworks

### Time Allocation

The quarter is structured with the following time allocation:

- **Module 1 (ROS 2)**: 3-4 weeks - Establishing the robotic nervous system
- **Module 2 (Digital Twins)**: 3-4 weeks - Simulation and testing environments
- **Module 3 (AI Brain)**: 4-5 weeks - Intelligence and decision-making systems
- **Module 4 (VLA Systems)**: 3-4 weeks - Perception-action integration
- **Capstone Project**: 2-3 weeks - Integration and demonstration

### Prerequisites Check

Before diving into each module, ensure you have:

- **Module 1**: Basic understanding of Linux command line and Python
- **Module 2**: Completion of Module 1 and basic understanding of simulation concepts
- **Module 3**: Completion of Modules 1-2 and familiarity with AI/ML concepts
- **Module 4**: Completion of Modules 1-3 and understanding of computer vision/NLP basics

### Assessment Strategy

Learning is assessed through:

1. **Module Exercises**: Practical implementation tasks
2. **Labs**: Guided projects applying concepts
3. **Cross-Module Integration**: Tasks that connect multiple modules
4. **Capstone Project**: Comprehensive implementation of all concepts

### Resources and Support

- **Glossary**: Technical terminology defined across all modules
- **Appendix**: Reference materials and additional resources
- **Code Examples**: Minimal, reproducible examples for each concept
- **Community**: Links to relevant forums and discussion groups

### Success Metrics

By the end of this quarter, you should be able to:

- Design and implement ROS 2-based robotic systems
- Create and use digital twin environments for robot development
- Integrate AI models into robotic control systems
- Implement vision-language-action systems for real-world interaction
- Complete an autonomous humanoid robot project

### Getting Started

Each module begins with learning objectives and prerequisites, followed by conceptual explanations, practical examples, and hands-on exercises. The structure allows for both sequential learning and independent exploration of topics that interest you most.

Let's begin with Module 1, where we'll establish the communication and control backbone for our humanoid robot using ROS 2.
