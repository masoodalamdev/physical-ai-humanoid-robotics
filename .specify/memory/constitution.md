# Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics: Embodied Intelligence in the Real World Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Educational Clarity
All content prioritizes educational clarity over marketing language, ensuring complex topics are accessible to students.

### II. Engineering-First Explanations
Explanations are grounded in engineering principles, supplemented with conceptual intuition to build a strong foundational understanding.

### III. Modular Learning
Content is structured into modular units, each aligned to a capstone-driven curriculum for practical application.

### IV. Minimal, Reproducible, Industry-Aligned Code
Code examples must be minimal, fully reproducible, and reflective of industry best practices.

### V. Open Standards Preference
Preference is given to open standards and established platforms including ROS 2, URDF, Gazebo, NVIDIA Isaac, and OpenAI APIs.

### VI. Deployable Content
All content must be deployable using Docusaurus and GitHub Pages to ensure broad accessibility and ease of maintenance.

### VII. Markdown-First Documentation
Documentation is primarily authored in Markdown, facilitating collaboration and version control.

### VIII. AI-Assisted, Human-Readable Writing
Content creation is AI-assisted via Claude Code, but the final output must be human-readable and student-friendly.

## Documentation Standards

Each module must contain:
- Concept overview
- System architecture diagrams (described in text)
- Tooling explanations
- Step-by-step labs
- Capstone alignment notes

Consistent terminology must be used across all chapters.
No unexplained acronyms are permitted.
A comprehensive glossary must be included.

## Governance

This Constitution supersedes all other project practices. Amendments require thorough documentation, explicit approval from project maintainers, and a clear migration plan for any affected content. All pull requests and content reviews must verify compliance with these principles. Complexity must always be justified against the principles of educational clarity and modularity.
